**Instructor:**				Dr. Sreedevi Gutta   
**Email:** 				[sgutta@csusm.edu](mailto:sgutta@csusm.edu)   
**Lecture Meeting Times:**	           MWF 8:30am \- 9:20am   
**Lecture Location**:               	University Hall 272  
**Office hours:** 			MWF 7:45am \- 8:30am (Academic Hall 314\)

# Course Description 

An introduction to the objectives and techniques used by practitioners and researchers in artificial intelligence. Explores a number of aspects of computational models of intelligence including problem solving (uninformed and informed strategies), game playing, knowledge representation, reasoning, planning, natural language processing (text and speech), and learning. *There will be a number of hands-on assignments that will allow the students to become familiar with the practice of building intelligence systems.* *May not be taken by students who have received credit for [CS 571](https://catalog.csusm.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=1&coid=499).*

*Prerequisite(s):* [*CS 311*](https://catalog.csusm.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=1&coid=461)*.*

# Course Materials

Materials covered for each class (notes and slides) will be provided in Canvas. 

# Learning Objectives

Students that successfully complete the course will be able to:

1. Design software agents that act rationally in complex domains   
2. Design and analyze the performance of an AI system or component    
3. Implement and debug core AI algorithms in a clean and structured manner   
4. Determine which AI technique(s) should be used to solve a particular problem   
5. Explain concisely the scope of AI, its potential for society as well as its limitations  
6. Discuss contemporary applications of AI from both a technical and an ethical perspective

# Assessment 

* **Quizzes**:  Effective learning of Canvas materials will be assessed via Canvas quizzes. There will be one quiz every week on the topics covered in that specific week.   
* **In-class Activities**: In-class individual/team activities to strengthen your understanding of the course content.   
* **Assignments**: Various assignments throughout the semester that focus on the implementation of various algorithms using Python. It is common for students to get stuck on some parts of an assignment. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you start working on the assignments early so that you will be in the position to pause from the work, ask for help and resume the work later when the responses arrive.  
* **Exams**: There will be two exams in this course.  
* **Final Project**: Team project where you will work on an end-to-end project on the topic of your choice.

# Course Policies

## Academic Honesty

Students will be expected to adhere to standards of academic honesty and integrity, as outlined in the Student Academic Honesty Policy. All written work and oral presentation assignments must be original work. All ideas/material that are borrowed from other sources must have appropriate references to the original sources. Any quoted material should give credit to the source and be punctuated with quotation marks.

 

Students are responsible for honest completion of their work including examinations. The instructor reserves the right to discipline any student for academic dishonesty, in accordance with the general rules and regulations of the university.  Disciplinary action may include the lowering of grades and/or the assignment of a failing grade for an exam, assignment, or the course as a whole. Incidents of Academic Dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students. Sanctions at the University level may include suspension or expulsion from the University.    
([http://www.csusm.edu/dos/conduct/index.html](http://www.csusm.edu/dos/conduct/index.html))

## Policy on Late/Missed Work

Part of college education is to develop time management skills. It is important to develop a weekly plan on how to balance time among different activities and responsibilities. The nature of this course requires timely attention to assigned work. Late/missed work in an early assignment is likely to cause a domino effect of falling further behind in class. Therefore, no late submission will be accepted for credit.   
Mark your calendar for the assignments, exam, and final project. NO MAKE-UP will be given for a missed exam or the final project presentation except under the most extraordinary of situations. 

## Campus Writing Requirement 

The University Writing Requirement of 2,500 words in this course will be exceeded by solving the problems on your homework, quiz, and test assignments. 

## ADA Statement 

Example:  Students with disabilities who require reasonable accommodations must be approved for services by providing appropriate and recent documentation to the [Office of Disability Support (DSS)](http://www.csusm.edu/dss/).  This office is located in Craven Hall 4200, and can be contacted by phone at (760) 750-4905, or TTY (760) 750-4909.  Email inquiries can be sent to [dss@csusm.edu](mailto:dss@csusm.edu). Students authorized by DSS to receive reasonable accommodations should meet with me during my office hours in order to ensure confidentiality. 

## Contact Information for Technical Support Assistance

Example: For questions or assistance with a technical part of the course, your campus username/password, your campus email, etc., please contact the [CSUSM Student Technology Help Desk](http://www.csusm.edu/sth/index.html). Email inquiries can be sent to [sth@csusm.edu](mailto:sth@csusm.edu). 

## Cougar Care Network (CCN)

Our campus has implemented a new early alert system to support and promote studentsâ€™ academic and personal success. I may refer you through the Cougar Care Network (CCN) to get connected to campus support and resources to assist you.

## Civility Campaign

The Civility Campaign, an effort led by the Dean of Students Office, defines civility to reflect the community values of CSUSM. The university strives to be a community demonstrating respect for oneself and for others, treatment of others with dignity, and behaviors which promote a physically and psychologically safe, secure and supportive climate enabling all community members to engage as full and active participants where the free flow of ideas are encouraged and affirmed.
