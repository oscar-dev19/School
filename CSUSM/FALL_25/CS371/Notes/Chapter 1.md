# Chapter 1: Introduction – Software Engineering

## What is Software Engineering?
- **Software Engineering**: An engineering discipline concerned with all aspects of software production.
- Focuses on:
  - Systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approaches to software development.
  - Practicalities of developing and maintaining software systems that are **useful** and **trustworthy**.

## FAQs in Software Engineering
- **Difference from Computer Science**:  
  - CS focuses on theory and fundamentals.  
  - SE focuses on developing reliable, cost-effective software in practice.  
- **Difference from System Engineering**:  
  - SE is a part of system engineering.  
  - SE focuses on software aspects; system engineering focuses on the whole system (hardware, people, processes).  

## Professional Software Development
- **Essential Attributes of Good Software**:
  1. **Maintainability** – evolves with changing needs.
  2. **Dependability & Security** – reliable, safe, and secure.
  3. **Efficiency** – good resource utilization.
  4. **Acceptability** – meets requirements, is usable and understandable.

- **Engineering vs. Craft**:  
  - Engineering uses **systematic and organized approaches** rather than ad-hoc coding.  

- **Diversity of Software**:  
  - **Standalone apps**, **interactive web services**, **embedded control systems**, etc.  
  - No universal methods; depends on application, people, and organization.  

## Software Engineering Ethics
- Engineers have responsibilities to the public, employers, and profession.
- Must adhere to codes of ethics (e.g., ACM, IEEE).
- **Key Ethical Issues**:
  1. **Confidentiality** – respect employer/user confidentiality.
  2. **Competence** – practice only within your expertise.
  3. **Intellectual Property** – respect copyrights, patents, etc.
  4. **Computer Misuse** – avoid unethical use of technical skills.

## Case Studies (Used Throughout the Book)
1. **Insulin Pump Control System** – safety-critical embedded system.  
2. **Mental Health Care Patient Management System (Mentcare)** – patient info and care coordination.  
3. **Wilderness Weather Station** – remote environment monitoring and reporting.  
4. **iLearn (Digital Learning Environment)** – adaptive learning system.  

These illustrate different application domains, requirements, and challenges.

## Key Takeaways
- SE is about **delivering dependable, efficient, maintainable, and acceptable software**.  
- Ethical responsibilities are central to professional practice.  
- No single best approach: methods depend on **application type, team, and context**.  
- Case studies provide real-world grounding for concepts.
